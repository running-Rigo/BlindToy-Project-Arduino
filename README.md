# BlindToy-Project-Arduino

This Arduino-code is part of a toy for blind dogs. I developed the microcontroller-toy, the app and the php backend during my programming-training at Codersbay Linz.

# Features:
Read data received via bluetooth; based on a switch-case the sound quality made by a buzzer changes

# Work in progress
I want to integrate functionality for a MP3 module with spoken sounds on a SD-card;
this sounds should also be played at the push of a button within the app
